# projects-that-help-me-learn
A short list of tutorial solutions to the projects found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aue19f/the_projects_that_helped_me_learn/)

Written in Python 3.6.4

I have not covered any 'setting up' or infrastructure here, but before you start these you'll need a python interpretter of some description, and to have downloaded/cloned the files from this repository.

The very basics of reading Python code are this:

```Python
# Any line preceded by an octothorp is a comments
"""
As are any lines surrounded by triple-double-quotes
"""
print("Anything else is code")
while True:
	print("<-- Make sure to respect whitespacing in Python")
```

I've written some basic instructions on the process of solving each problem in the source code itself. The comments will start off heavy, and then get lighter as we go on and I get more bored of typing. If you have trouble following along, try to modify some of the previous exercises from you got stuck, to make sure the knowledge is nice and general and not over-fit to that particular solution.

Finally, I'm a human being and make mistakes, and am definitely not the slipperiest Pythoneer in the universe, so feel free to contact me [here](https://www.reddit.com/u/spudmix/) if you have any complaints or questions.
